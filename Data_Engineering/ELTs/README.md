# ELTs - Extract, Load, Transform  

This section of my professional portfolio showcases the ETLs (Extract, Load, Transform processes) I have developed for various platforms. Each ETL is designed to efficiently handle data extraction, transformation, and loading tasks tailored to specific use cases. Below is a detailed description of the contents of this folder:  

## Folder Structure  

### `/platform/`  
- **Description**: Contains the ETL pipeline developed for Platform 1.  
- **Files**:  
    - `etl_platform.py`: Class to interact with Platform 1's API.  
    - `main_platform1.py`: Script that uses `etl_platform.py` and utility classes to retrieve and export data to BigQuery.   


This section highlights my ability to design and implement robust ETL pipelines tailored to diverse data platforms.
