# Utils - Data Engineering Tools

This section of the portfolio showcases a collection of tools and libraries I have developed to streamline and enhance data engineering workflows. Below is a detailed description of the content in this directory:

## Folder Structure

### `/GoogleCloudHandlers/`
Contains tools specifically designed to interact with Google Cloud Platform services.

- **`bigquery_handler.py`**: Simplifies interactions with Google BigQuery, including querying, table creation, and data insertion.
- **`bigquery_loader.py`**: Automates the process of loading data into BigQuery from various sources.
- **`cloud_function_handler.py`**: Provides utilities for deploying and managing Google Cloud Functions.
- **`service_account_handler.py`**: Manages Google Cloud service account authentication and permissions.

### `/Lib/`
Custom Python libraries that encapsulate reusable functionality for general-purpose data engineering tasks.

- **`excelHandler.py`**: Facilitates reading, writing, and manipulating Excel files for data processing.
- **`fileZipper.py`**: Compresses and decompresses files to optimize storage and transfer.
- **`schema_generator.py`**: Automatically generates data schemas based on sample datasets or predefined rules.


This section demonstrates my ability to identify pain points in data engineering workflows and develop practical solutions to address them. Each tool and library is designed with scalability, maintainability, and ease of use in mind.
